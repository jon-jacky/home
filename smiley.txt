  "In the course of 650 years, Boccaccio and his successors have helped to
  create a certain kind of world.  It is a world not unlike the novel ...
  In this world everyone, male or female, could become, might be, his or her
  own protagonist ... In this world individual existence has the potential for
  meaning -- it can be understood and possibly changed ... Cause and effect
  can be disentangled and observed ... In this world the ordinary person 
  can step back, observe both the world and himself or herself, make a 
  judgment, and then make a choice ...

  ... the world I thought was established and secure, at least
  in the West, is more fragile than I thought, because it is newer than I
  realized.  That a woman could be an agent rather than an object or a
  possession, that a marriage can be chosen, then rejected, that an identity
  can be constructed by an ordinary person -- these are difficult ideas, 
  strange to many, and dangerous to some.   The tension between the 
  individual and the group that the novel depicts is ofen intolerable to 
  the group, and for some groups, an individual does not have a right to 
  a point of view.  The routine quality of the novel, the way that novels
  seem ubiquitous and benign, pleasurable, or fun, or even tedious to 
  schoolchildren, masks their subversiveness and helps us forget how they
  have remade the world. ...

  Pride, arrogance, moral blindness, and narcissism are endemic among 
  humans, especially humans who occupy positions of power, either in society
  or in the family.  But when I have read a long novel, when I have entered
  systematically into a sensibility that is alien to mine, the author's or 
  a character's, when I have become interested in another person because he
  is interesting, not because he is privileged or great, there is a possibility
  that at the end I will be a degree less self-centered than I was at the
  beginning, that I will be a degree more able to see the world as another
  sees it.  And there is a possibity that I will be able to reason about my
  own emotions.   In the end I will be more empathetic ... and I will be 
  more sympathetic ...

  When we talk about the death of the novel, what we are really talking
  about is the possilibility that empathy, however minimal, would no longer
  be attainable by those for whom the novel has died. ... If the novel has
  died for men ... then the inner lives of their friends and family 
  members are a degree more closed to them than before.  If the novel dies,
  or never lives, for children and teenagers who spend their time watching
  TV or playing video games, then they will always be somewhat mystified by
  others, and by themselves as well. ...

  My guess is that mere technology will not kill the novel. ... Nor do I 
  believe that novels are bannable. ...  But novels can be sidelined --
  dismissed to the seraglio where they are read by women and children and
  have no effect on those in power.   When that happens, our society will
  be brutalized and coarsened by people who speak rather like us and look
  rather like us but who have no way of understanding us or each other."
