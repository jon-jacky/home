  Beyond Easy - "... we've got *Rooty Toot Toot*, United Productions of America's
  Oscar-nominated 1951 short. ..."

  "UPA (was) the most important cartoon studio you've never heard of. ...
  To help us get an idea of how UPA changed the animation game, let's do a
  compare/contrast exercise. Below are three pairs of video links. The
  first of each pair is a cartoon from 1947, and the second is a cartoon
  from about ten years later, starring the same character(s) as the first.
  ... Yes, we're looking at a cheapening of animation, but let's put this
  into context. ... (After 1947) animation workshops had to adjust their
  production budgets accordingly or shut their doors ... And the studio
  that showed the field how to make more economical use of their resources
  was none other than UPA.

  UPA's aesthetic and its repertoire of economical animation techniques
  came to be called "limited animation" -- to the chagrin of *Rooty Toot
  Toot*'s director John Hubley, who preferred "stylized animation." ...
  Hubley and his colleagues saw limited animation as a
  way to improve the visual quality of cartoons, not dilute it. ...

  *Rooty Toot Toot* is a brief musical based on "Frankie and Johnny,"  (a
  song about a jealous woman who shoots her lover). A jazzy Rashomon-
  structured courtroom drama unfolds, with three characters giving three
  different accounts of the events preceding Johnny's death. ...  *Rooty
  Toot Toot* definitely has its highlights ... Frankie's dancing ... (her
  rival) Nellie Bly's sultry, octopoid voluptuousness ... The strange,
  alternating transparencies of Frankie and Nelly's limbs and garments are
  a trick that wouldn't seem out of place in the modernism/cubism section
  of an art gallery. ...

  What's most interesting to me about Phil Moore and Allen Alch's score is
  its -- let's call it dissonance. ... The tune is modeled after "Frankie
  and Johnny" ...  But after the first couple of stanzas, the verses stop
  scanning ... Verses will be spoken instead of sung; the tempo
  fluctuates; the singers change; there are pauses and interruptions.

  *Rooty Toot Toot* is the magnum opus of John Hubley's career at UPA, and
  also his last hurrah. In 1952, he was blacklisted for refusing to name
  names before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He had no
  choice but to leave UPA and strike out on his own. He continued working
  in animation for the rest of his life (frequently partnering with his
  wife Faith), but virtually nothing as high-profile as his work with UPA. ..."

- https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/what-the-upa-style-actually-is -
  What the 'UPA Style' Actually Is - "(In the 1930s) 
  its star artists like John Hubley and Jules Engel were young upstarts at
  Disney, chafing against the house style. ...
  Disney's aesthetic in films like Bambi drew from older, more realistic
  art. Hubley often called it eighteenth-century watercolor. In
  retrospect, Jules Engel put it like this:

  - We had other concepts of what an animated film should look like
    [...] we were aware of Matisse. We were aware of Paul Klee    and
    Kandinsky. Dufy was, I think, very important for us. Leger was    very
    important for us.

  Hubley, Engel and the others eventually left. When the Disney expats
  started what would become UPA in the mid-1940s, this blend of influences
  guided their way. They'd borrow as well from modern illustrators like
  Saul Steinberg. By the time UPA won an Oscar for *Gerald McBoing-Boing* in
  1951, it had figured out a new style of cartoon. ...
  It was slick and ultra-contemporary, and it placed UPA squarely in the
  movement of 'mid-century modern' aesthetics. This was art for the *modern
  world*, as people in the 50s saw it."

  This page shows paintings by Dufy, Kandinsky, Leger, Mondrian, Matisse,
  and Klee, and scenes from UPA cartoons *Mr. Magoo*, *Madeline*, and
  *Gerald McBoing-Boing*.  It also shows scenes from recent cartoons made
  in the 'UPA Revival' style: *The Powerpuff Girls*, *Rooty Toot Toot*, and

  Hacking the Five-String Banjo

  "I'm a big fan of the inlay work done on 19th century American folk
  instruments and furniture, and the kinds of ornamentation that was
  popular during the American Fancy movement. I had an Architect friend
  who told me once that modernist aesthetics have caused us to
  collectively forget how to be ornamental. I tend to agree. ... After
  designing some paper prototypes, taped to the banjo ... I moved on to
  making some copper stick-on inlays using a vinyl cutter and copper foil.
  I also used the C4DMs laser cutter to fashion a new head for the banjo
  from blue acrylic, featuring some ornamental patterns inspired by the
  Fancy aesthetic. ...

  .. it became clear that an old-time knocking banjo player potentially
  has some free bandwidth in their right hand that could be built upon. To
  do this I leveraged two technologies that were being prototyped at the
  Augmented Instruments Lab, the touch-sensing Trill and the magnetic-
  field sensing tech used to sense guitar picking motions in the Magpick.
  ... Since I'm using SuperCollider for all my live electronic sound needs,
  I needed to develop some custom UGens for the Bela to be able to get the
  Trill sensor's data into my signal chains. ...

  That's a lot of signals going in and out ... I wanted to have a dashboard
  for the purpose of debugging signals and making sure everything in the

- http://www.laffpix.com/howtoreadnancy.pdf - How To Read Nancy by Mark
  Newgarden and Paul Karasik - "'How to read Nancy?' you may sneer, 'You
  might as well explain how to read a stop sign.'  You're half right, but
  there's a lot more to Enrie Bushmiller's work than meets the eye ... No
  other cartoonist has worked with such consistent economy ... Nancy only
  appears to be simple at a casual glance. ... Minimalist? Formalist?
  Structuralist?  Cartoonist!

  There is little that is beneath Bushmiller in his quest for a gag.
  A kind of sublime dumbness became Bushmiller's personal territory and
  he mined it brilliantly. ...  Bushmiller realized that gag knows no
  I.Q. and that the success or failure of a given gag relies much more
  on its own inner mechanisms than the sophistication of its premise. ...

  (See link below to the new Nancy strip by another cartoonist.)
