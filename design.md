  A 'literate program' presented in a single assembly language source

  x86 assembly implementation of Forth, more on which here:
  <http://rwmj.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/jonesforth-git-repository/>

  "... FORTH is minimal.  You really can write a complete FORTH in, say, 2000
  lines of code.  I don't just mean a FORTH program, I mean a complete
  FORTH operating system, environment and language.  You could boot such a
  FORTH on a bare PC and it would come up with a prompt where you could
  start doing useful work.  The FORTH you have here isn't minimal and uses
  a Linux process as its 'base PC' (both for the purposes of making it a
  good tutorial). ...

  ... FORTH has a peculiar bootstrapping property.  By that I mean that
  after writing a little bit of assembly to talk to the hardware and
  implement a few primitives, all the rest of the language and compiler is
  written in FORTH itself. ..."

  Hacking the Five-String Banjo

  "I'm a big fan of the inlay work done on 19th century American folk
  instruments and furniture, and the kinds of ornamentation that was
  popular during the American Fancy movement. I had an Architect friend
  who told me once that modernist aesthetics have caused us to
  collectively forget how to be ornamental. I tend to agree. ... After
  designing some paper prototypes, taped to the banjo ... I moved on to
  making some copper stick-on inlays using a vinyl cutter and copper foil.
  I also used the C4DMs laser cutter to fashion a new head for the banjo
  from blue acrylic, featuring some ornamental patterns inspired by the
  Fancy aesthetic. ...

  .. it became clear that an old-time knocking banjo player potentially
  has some free bandwidth in their right hand that could be built upon. To
  do this I leveraged two technologies that were being prototyped at the
  Augmented Instruments Lab, the touch-sensing Trill and the magnetic-
  field sensing tech used to sense guitar picking motions in the Magpick.
  ... Since I'm using SuperCollider for all my live electronic sound needs,
  I needed to develop some custom UGens for the Bela to be able to get the
  Trill sensor's data into my signal chains. ...

  That's a lot of signals going in and out ... I wanted to have a dashboard
  for the purpose of debugging signals and making sure everything in the
  banjo was working ... I started building up a signal visualization
  system. ..."

  Newgarden and Paul Karasik - "'How to read Nancy?' you may sneer, 'You
  might as well explain how to read a stop sign.'  You're half right, but
  there's a lot more to Enrie Bushmiller's work than meets the eye ... No
  other cartoonist has worked with such consistent economy ... Nancy only
  appears to be simple at a casual glance. ... Minimalist? Formalist?
  Structuralist?  Cartoonist!

  There is little that is beneath Bushmiller in his quest for a gag.
  A kind of sublime dumbness became Bushmiller's personal territory and
  he mined it brilliantly. ...  Bushmiller realized that gag knows no
  I.Q. and that the success or failure of a given gag relies much more
  on its own inner mechanisms than the sophistication of its premise. ...
