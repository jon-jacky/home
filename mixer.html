<p>
A device for controlling gas concentration as a function of time
according to a predetermined program is described.  The apparatus is
capable of producing any arbitrary time-varying gas concentration at
frequencies up to about 4 Hz and can be set to ultra-low frequencies
with excellent accuracy and repeatability.  The apparatus consists of
a single on/off solenoid valve for each gas in the mixture, all
controlled by a <a href="kim1.html">microcomputer</a>.  
The valve is rapidly pulsed open and
closed, and the concentration of the corresponding gas in the mixture
is proportional to the fraction of the cycle for which the valve
remains open.  Prior to an experiment, numerical values representing
the amplitude of the desired concentration wave form at successive
time intervals are entered into the computer memory.  When the program
is run, the microcomputer successively translates each of these values
into a pulse-width modulated signal that opens and closes the valves
via optically isolated relays.  The processor can also translate an
external control signal into the corresponding pulse train, permitting
manual or automatic control of the mixture.  The apparatus can be
assembled in several hours from readily available components costing
under $600, including the microcomputer.
