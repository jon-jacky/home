  "... itâ€™s odd that Facebook is valued at over $400B while nearly all
  users of the platform make $0 for producing its content. ... The
  ultimate vision for Cent is to become an income source for anyone
  who wants to provide their value to society via a digital network."
  Prototype at https://beta.cent.co/ Promotion at https://www.cent.co/
  Via https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17694135 "... paying users
  for providing responses that are no different than FB posts or
  Tweets. The difference between Cent and FB and Twitter though is
  that users on Cent are responding to posts that have a monetary
  bounty attached to them..."  

  Interesting idea, but poor implementation with a weird community.
  The tweet format does not lend itself to high-value content -- most
  tweets are worthless.  Much of the activity at the prototype site is
  chitchat from enthusiasts for cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
  According to https://beta.cent.co/leaderboard, the top earner made
  $36.99 in 30 days.  Compare to much higher quality questions,
