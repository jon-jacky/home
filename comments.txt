  Philip K. Dick's novel *Time Out of Joint* predicted nostalgia for the
  1950s -- *in the 1950s*. (Spoilers follow) The main character is made
  to believe he is living in an idyllic 1950s America. But then he
  finds out he is actually living in a dystopic 1990s America. He is
  frightened when he enounters teenagers with spiked hair and tattoos.
  This was written in 1959!

  *The Flame Alphabet* by Ben Marcus is about an epidemic where language
  is literally toxic -- hearing or reading speech makes people sick. I
  found it vivid, convincing,and memorable, but it contains so many weird
  and disturbing elements that I think a lot of people wouldn't like it.
  It was marketed (in 2012) as literary fiction, not sci-fi.

  He became famous later, but the last section of Jack Kerouac's mostly
  ignored first novel *The Town and the City* describes a young man from a
  small New England town moving to New York city right after World War
  Two. There is a memorable description of his bus passing through the
  country, then the suburbs, then the boroughs, then Manhattan. Then his
  early months there and the people he meets. I wouldn't call it
  lighthearted/humorous, but there is a lot of vivid description and
  emotional depth.

  Lots of description and activities of his new friends - some based on
  Allen Ginsberg and others who became famous later - but here they are
  not yet The Beats, they are just some people he knows. It is fascinating
  to see this crowd, who have been so thoroughly covered in gonzo style
  later, first described by a then-conventional writer in a style that
  looks back to the thirties, with no foreshadowing of their future fame
  or cultural influence.

  I just ran across a review (from 2013) of Kurt Vonnegut's collected
  letters. He was working in public relations for General Electric (in the
  early 1950s, I gather) when he sold his first story to *Collier's* (a
  large-circulation magazine of the time). He wrote to his father that if
  he could sell five stories a year, he would make more than a year's pay
  at GE.

  But he wrote in 1986, "the magazines had gone out of business, and I was
  suddenly in the position of having to write a whole book in order to get
  what used to be my fee for just one story."

  It's not much about maths, it's a memoir by a particular mathematician
  written at an unhappy point in his life, reflecting back on what he has
  done. It belongs more to the literature about artists and creativity, than
  to books of mathematical content. For that, see instead Hardy's *Course of
  Pure Mathematics* [1] If you do read the *Apology*, be sure to get an edition
  with C.P. Snow's forward, which gives the back story that puts Hardy's
  memoir in context. It also includes the wonderful story of Hardy and
  Ramanujan.

   Ted Nelson's best-known and most influential contribution was not Xanadu,
   but his book *Computer Lib/Dream Machines*, which appeared in 1974. Doesn't
   anyone remember this? It was ubiquitous at the beginning of the personal
   computer era. This self-published book was very much of its time - it had
   the same oversize-on-newsprint format and DIY look as *The Whole Earth
   Catalog*, which was popular at the same time. It was important because it
   pursuasively made the case that computing was about to become a medium
   for self-expresson - a "dream machine" - that was an unheard-of concept
   at the time. You can use a computer to produce graphics! To play games!
   How about that! He told about Sutherland's Sketchpad and Englebart's NLS
   and at a time when these were completely invisible to almost everyone.
   Xanadu gets a few pages in the book but it is not at all a work of self-
   promotion - almost the whole book is about the work of others. It's a
   survey of the computing scene right before personal computers appeared.
   This book was very timely and I think it provided a lot of inspiration
   for the personal computer movement. It made you want to try out
   computing! It has one page about microprocessors: "Here they come ...
   Microprocessors are what's happening" (the MITS Altair appeared the next
   year, in 1975).
  
   I think Ted Nelson is one of those people whose main effects are through
   their influence on others, rather than through what they directly
   produce themselves.

  These old photos do not convey the noise and spectacle. The guys are in
  white shirts and ties, but those old machine rooms were more like a
  factory floor than an office. Part of the reason they were separated off
  was to try to contain the noise. Those line printers struck the page with
  132 characters at once - WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! - and the paper is almost
  flying out the top. Those high speed card readers consumed a stack of
  thousands of cards in a minute - it reminded you of a log moving into the
  whirling blade at a sawmill. Then there was the roar (not hum) of the
  fans and the banging of the keypunches and teletypes - much louder than
  typewriters. You really got the sense that computation was a physical,
  mechanical process that consumed a lot of energy.

  For HN readers, what makes an era's technology appealing are the
  opportunities it presents to be creative and make a contribution. By that
  measure 1979 was not worse than today, in some ways it was more
  interesting because there was more variety and it wasn't clear which few
  technologies would shake out. Look at a 1979 issue of BYTE - in addition
  to Apple and Microsoft there were hundreds of other companies of similar
  size pursuing promising, eccentric, and/or dead-end ideas.

  You have to distinguish the Beatles' innovation and influence -- which are
  indisputable -- from whether some particular person might enjoy their
  music. A person can't really appreciate their importance unless they can
  remember what pop music and pop culture were like before they appeared.
  Pop music and pop culture changed enormously in the few years 1963 -- 1967
  and the Beatles led the charge. A lot of their influence was cultural, not
  musical at all.
  
  For example their 'bad haircuts' -- the important thing was that they were
  the first celebrity men in mainstream western culture to have long hair in
  the 20th century. It is hard to believe now how shocking this was at the
  time. Men couldn't have long hair -- it just wasn't done! I remember
  editorials claiming it indicated the end of western civilization. But then
  it changed almost overnight - everyone imitated them, if you were in a
  rock band you had to have long hair, and it became an option for everyone.
  
  This was just one aspect of a big shift in pop culture from encouragement
  of duty and conformity to permission for self-expression and hedonism, and
  the Beatles were in the vanguard of that. For those of us who remember it,
  it is difficult to separate the importance of all this from the quality
  (or lack of it) in the Beatles' music. But for young people now the
  Beatles' music doesn't have any of these connotations -- it has to stand
  on its own.

    chorus girl, the burglar in the striped sweater, the top-hatted banker,
    the painter with his beret, and the writer in his smoking jacket, the
    rock star must finally be consigned to the wardrobe of anachronistic

  Hepworth, Henry Holt and Company, NY 2017
  
  This book is amusing, but makes a real point - the rock star persona could
  only exist for a moment in history, the forty years from about 1954 to
  1994. People no longer experience popular music the way they did in that
  era, so rock stars in that sense can no longer appear. The deaths of
  musicians from that era make the impression they do because they are
  reminders of that experience, which cannot be recreated in the present any
  more.

  Davis demonstrated that it is possible to build a complete system from
  scratch that expresses your own philosophy and preferences, no matter how
  eccentric. He showed you can build a complete system just for yourself
  with no compromises arising from dependencies on other systems. There is
  some similarity in motivation with Wirth et al's Oberon system and Kay et
  al's Smalltalk and VPRI systems, but unlike them Davis was working
  entirely without professional or institutional connections, all the while
  beset by demons most of us cannot imagine. Davis showed that almost anyone
  starting out with modest technical skills and few resources, but enormous
  focus and motivation and time available, can do what Wirth et al and Kay
  et al can do.
  
  Davis' work shows the way to a completely different path than the
  prevailing hegemonic trend to try to build this or that system that
  everyone will use, that will take over the world. Maybe everyone deserves
  their own completely idiosyncratic and personalized system that can keep
  on working for them despite whatever the industry behemoths do. Perhaps an
  interesting research project might be to try to find ways to enable
  ordinary developers or even ordinary people to make such personalized
  stand-alone systems with no dependencies, without requiring years of

  Western Classical Music

  Today's rock/pop music is a direct descendant of classical music. The
  similarity to baroque sonatas and concertos is the clearest - that is why
  Bach Handel Teleman etc. make the easiest path into classical music to
  someone familiar with modern rock/pop. Baroque music has the same
  structure as modern rock/pop - a tune on top of a chord progression. It's
  a running joke in music circles that Pachelbel's Canon in D sounds
  familiar the first time you hear it because its chord progression appears
  in countless modern pop tunes. The basic baroque ensemble is like an
  unamplified rock band without drums. There is a rhythm section called the
  "continuo" constisting of a bass instrument like a cello or viola da gamba
  or bassoon - that's like the bass guitar - and a chordal instrument like a
  harpsichord or organ or lute or theorbo or ... that's like the rhythm
  guitar or piano or organ. Then there is a violin and/or flute or other
  melody instruments - that's like the lead guitar and/or saxophone or
  singer. The continuo part was usually written in a notation called
  'figured bass' that was analogous to modern chord charts. Besides that,
  the soulful singer songwriter goes back at least to the medieval
  troubadours, but appears in essentially modern form with the lute song
  composers of the 16th and 17th century - the model here is John Dowland,
  who in addition to composing a lot of melancholy songs, also composed some
  guitar-god-like solo instrumentals. And, this lute music was typically
  published in a tabular notation a lot like modern guitar tab.

  Programming in Haskell
  
  I recently looked at SICP again after first reading it many years ago. I
  had retained the overall impression that SICP demonstrates how to build
  many of the celebrated creations of computer science - interpreters,
  compilers, databases, logic programming systems, circuit simulators -
  using a very simple programming language with just a few constructs.
  
  But I had forgotten many of the details. Here is just one: in 3.1.1, Local
  State Variables, SICP shows how to, in effect, define classes and create
  objects using only function definition with *lambda* and *set!* (that is,
  assignment) in the definition body. The function you define this way is a
  like a class, the functions it returns are like instances. So you can do
  all this without any specifically object-oriented language features. This
  occupies just a few pages near the beginning of a long book - the whole
  book is dense with worked-out ideas like this.
  
  The cumulative effect of all these examples in SICP is to demonstrate that
  you can solve any programming problem from first principles - that is, by
  combining a few simple but powerful constructs in the several ways they
  describe. Moreover, a solution constructed this way might be simpler and
  easier to understand than a solution made the more usual way: by looking
  for a specialized language construct or library that seems to offer an
  already-made solution to the problem.

  in 1968

  I graduated from high school in 1968 and I find that media and its
  contents *including the internet* are more centralized and homogeneous now
  than they were then. The internet did not not just add to the mainstream
  media, it replaced some of its most interesting parts and replaced much
  the underground media that existed alongside it. In those days it was not
  just Time/Life/Newsweek/ABC/NBC/CBS, you could also find on the newstand
  left- and dissident journals like Ramparts and Evergreen Review, and their
  right wing counterparts. And, some of the contents of the mainstream media
  itself were higher quality and more varied. Compare a current issue of
  Esquire or Rolling Stone - now mostly entertainment industry promotion and
  fluff - with a 1968 issue, where they had very long articles by authors
  like Hunter Thompson, Tom Wolfe, Joan Didion, Oriana Fallaci, and many
  more. 

  Beyond that there was a thriving world of underground papers and
  newsletters with contents ranging from sharp and pertinent to crackpot,
  with odd and sometimes wonderful DIY production and design. Not just print
  media - the FM radio station I listened to was literaly underground, their
  studio was in a church basement. People organized huge demostrations using
  these DIY media. 

  Yes, it is probably easier now for a random person to get
  their opinions in front of a lot of eyes, but most of these carry little
  information, they mostly just repeat what the writer has seen/read
  elsewhere - and it appears on the same homogeneous platform with
  everything else. It takes a bit more energy and ingenuity to express your
  opinions or self-expression in a self-published mimeographed or xeroxed
  newsletter, but it contributes more variety and might even make a bigger
  impression.

  I recall when I was a kid, a Flat Earth guy was interviewed on TV after

  could see the round earth out his window and he could see he was passing
  over the entire circumference of the Earth every ninety minutes and
  ground stations around the world could track him coming over the horizon
  and passing overhead and ... etc. etc. The flat earth guy earnestly
  explained that Glenn was just circling around the edge - the perimeter -
  of the flat Earth, don't you see? - all the while making circular hand
  motions around the edge of the the flat table top where he was seated. I
  figured even then that the flat earth guy was just putting on the
