  It's not much about maths, it's a memoir by a particular mathematician
  written at an unhappy point in his life, reflecting back on what he has
  done. It belongs more to the literature about artists and creativity, than
  to books of mathematical content. For that, see instead Hardy's *Course of
  Pure Mathematics* [1] If you do read the *Apology*, be sure to get an edition
  with C.P. Snow's forward, which gives the back story that puts Hardy's
  memoir in context. It also includes the wonderful story of Hardy and
  Ramanujan.

   Ted Nelson's best-known and most influential contribution was not Xanadu,
   but his book *Computer Lib/Dream Machines*, which appeared in 1974. Doesn't
   anyone remember this? It was ubiquitous at the beginning of the personal
   computer era. This self-published book was very much of its time - it had
   the same oversize-on-newsprint format and DIY look as *The Whole Earth
   Catalog*, which was popular at the same time. It was important because it
   pursuasively made the case that computing was about to become a medium
   for self-expresson - a "dream machine" - that was an unheard-of concept
   at the time. You can use a computer to produce graphics! To play games!
   How about that! He told about Sutherland's Sketchpad and Englebart's NLS
   and at a time when these were completely invisible to almost everyone.
   Xanadu gets a few pages in the book but it is not at all a work of self-
   promotion - almost the whole book is about the work of others. It's a
   survey of the computing scene right before personal computers appeared.
   This book was very timely and I think it provided a lot of inspiration
   for the personal computer movement. It made you want to try out
   computing! It has one page about microprocessors: "Here they come ...
   Microprocessors are what's happening" (the MITS Altair appeared the next
   year, in 1975).
  
   I think Ted Nelson is one of those people whose main effects are through
   their influence on others, rather than through what they directly
   produce themselves.

  These old photos do not convey the noise and spectacle. The guys are in
  white shirts and ties, but those old machine rooms were more like a
  factory floor than an office. Part of the reason they were separated off
  was to try to contain the noise. Those line printers struck the page with
  132 characters at once - WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! - and the paper is almost
  flying out the top. Those high speed card readers consumed a stack of
  thousands of cards in a minute - it reminded you of a log moving into the
  whirling blade at a sawmill. Then there was the roar (not hum) of the
  fans and the banging of the keypunches and teletypes - much louder than
  typewriters. You really got the sense that computation was a physical,
  mechanical process that consumed a lot of energy.

  turn out the way we hoped

  1979 - !? Your challenge might pose a dilemma if you said 1879 or 1479 -
  but 1979 was just yesterday. Instead of Hacker News, you would have
  Usenet. Instead of Google and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple you would
  have IBM and DEC ... and Microsoft and Apple. Instead of programming in
  Javascript and Python and Lisp and C you would use BASIC and Pascal ...
  and Lisp and C. Instead of running on Windows or Linux it would run on VMS
  or Unix.  

  For HN readers, what makes an era's technology appealing are the
  opportunities it presents to be creative and make a contribution. By that
  measure 1979 was not worse than today, in some ways it was more
  interesting because there was more variety and it wasn't clear which few
  technologies would shake out. Look at a 1979 issue of BYTE - in addition
  to Apple and Microsoft there were hundreds of other companies of similar
  size pursuing promising, eccentric, and/or dead-end ideas.  

  For another view of computing as seen from the 1970s, including many
  roads not taken, see Bret Victor's "The Future of Programming":

  In *The Autobiography of Malcolm X*, he tells how he learned to read and
  write by copying out, *by hand*, the *entire dictionary* from the prison
  library, copying a page a day. (It's in chapter 11 of the *Autobiography*).

  and fiction
  
  There was a burst of this in the 1950s and 1960s, inspired by interest
  in/anxiety about science and math prompted by Sputnik, the space race, and
  nuclear war. So these are period pieces but you still might enjoy them --
  I did:
  
  *Fantasia Mathematica* (1958) and *The Mathematical Magpie* (1962), two short
  story collections edited by Clifton Fadiman
  
  *Mathenauts* (1967), short story collection edited by Rudy Rucker
  
  *The Space Child's Mother Goose* (1958?), poetry
  
  Come to think of it, *A Wrinkle In Time* by Madeline L'Engle (1962) fits
  right in with this group. The math and cold war anxiety themes are
  stronger in the book than in the recent movie.
