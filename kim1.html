<h3>KIM-1 Microcomputer</h3>

<hr>

<p>
The <strong>KIM-1</strong> was bare-bones but it cost much less than the early
personal computers of the day -- only $250 -- and it was completely
self-contained -- you didn't need a terminal or a host computer to use
it.  It had lots of programmable input/output ports, so sou could make
it into an embedded controller that did useful work, for example the
labelling machine in the "How I coded" link below, or the gas mixer
described <a href="mixer.html">here</a>.

  KIM-1</a>, pictures, manuals, and software</a>:
  "This prehistoric computer has no 'real' keyboard
  and no video output; programs are entered by the small hexadecimal
  keyboard ... and results are displayed on the small LED screen ..."

  How I coded in 1985</a>, more pictures and hand-written sample code: 
  "... there wasn't an assembler and the KIM-1 just had a hex keypad and
  small display. So, it meant writing the code by hand, hand assembling
  and typing it in. ..."

The KIM-1 was even used to make new music, by
<a href="http://www.sothismedias.com/home/the-league-of-automatic-music-composers">The League of Automatic Music Composers</a>: "...  The two pieces on the
album feature the KIM-1 microcomputer with flute and bassoon on the
title piece, and cello and the KIM-1 on the flip side, Figure in a
Clearing. In these pieces the KIM-1 listens to the live performers,
and accompanies or marks points when particular pitches are
played. ..." (This page links to the full album on YouTube and
discusses other pieces that used one or more KIM-1s, including photos
of the group performing with their homemade equipment.)
